🚀 Hackathon Idea Generator
🧠 A Generative AI-based project designed to spark creativity and innovation for hackathon participants.
📜 Problem Statement

Brainstorming unique and impactful ideas within the short timeframe of a hackathon is a major challenge for many participants. It’s difficult to balance creativity with technical feasibility and real-world relevance.

The Hackathon Idea Generator solves this by using Generative AI to automatically produce hackathon project ideas tailored to user preferences, such as domains (e.g., healthcare, sustainability, fintech, education) and complexity levels.

By integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the project combines the power of large language models with real-world information retrieval — ensuring the generated ideas are not only creative but also current, feasible, and grounded in real-world applications.

💡 Objectives

Generate innovative and domain-specific hackathon ideas using AI.

Leverage RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to fetch real-time, relevant information.

Encourage creativity, innovation, and technical accuracy in idea generation.

Save time during hackathons by simplifying the ideation process.

🌟 Example Use Cases

💬 AI Chatbot that interacts with users to generate project ideas

📰 Text Summarizer for compressing long problem statements

🖼️ Image Caption Generator for hackathon presentation materials

💡 Idea & Content Generator for fast concept creation

💻 Code Assistant capable of suggesting relevant project structures

🧩 How RAG Enhances It

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches AI outputs by allowing the model to retrieve factual, up-to-date, and domain-specific data before generating an idea.
This ensures every suggestion is:

✅ Context-aware

✅ Backed by real-world insights

✅ Technically and thematically relevant

🚀 Future Enhancements

Fine-tuned models for specific hackathon categories

Multi-user collaborative brainstorming sessions

AI evaluation of idea feasibility and innovation level

Integration of voice and image-based inputs
